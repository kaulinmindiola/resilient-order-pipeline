# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture decisions for **Resilient Order Pipeline**, a reference backend that demonstrates the transactional outbox, idempotent consumers, retries with dead-letter topics, oversell-free concurrency and tolerance to Kafka outages.

All records follow a reduced [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format. Each one contains:

1. **Context and Problem Statement**: the forces and requirements behind the decision.
2. **Decision Drivers** and **Considered Options**.
3. **Decision Outcome**, including **Consequences** (good and bad, stated honestly).
4. **Confirmation**: the test or check that demonstrates the decision. Test numbers refer to the evidence tests listed in the main README; links are added in the pull request of the phase that implements each test.
5. **Pros and Cons of the Options** and **More Information** (related ADRs and requirement IDs).

All ADRs are `accepted` as of 2026-10-05.

## Reading order

* **The core reliability story:** 0001 → 0011 → 0004 → 0010 → 0013.
* **Data boundaries:** 0002 → 0015 → 0009 → 0014 → 0018.
* **Code structure:** 0006 → 0016.

## Changing a decision

* Changing a decision means updating the affected ADR, together with every document it touches, in the **same pull request**.
* A reversed decision is not erased: its status becomes `superseded by ADR-XXXX` and the new ADR explains why.
* Identifiers (`ADR-*`, `BR-*`, `REQ-*`) are stable and are cited in tests, commit messages and documentation.
